Speciﬁcally, we use reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF; Christiano et al., 2017; Stiennon et al., 2020) to ﬁne-tune GPT-3 to follow a broad class of written instructions. This technique uses human preferences as a reward signal to ﬁne-tune our models. We ﬁrst hire a team of 40 contractors to label our data, based on their performance on a screening tes We then collect a dataset of human-written demonstrations of the desired output behavior on (mostly English) prompts submitted to the OpenAI API3 and some labeler-written prompts, and use this to train our supervised learning baselines. Next, we collect a dataset of human-labeled comparisons between outputs from our models on a larger set of API prompts. We then train a reward model (RM) on this dataset to predict which model output our labelers would prefer. Finally, we use this RM as a reward function and ﬁne-tune our supervised learning baseline to maximize this reward using the PPO algorithm\nPaper Results We call the resulting models InstructGPT. {:height 636, :width 1038}\nOn the TruthfulQA benchmark, InstructGPT generates truthful and informative answers about twice as often as GPT-3 During RLHF ﬁne-tuning, we observe performance regressions compared to GPT-3 We can greatly reduce the performance regressions on these datasets by mixing PPO updates with updates that increase the log likelihood of the pretraining distribution (PPO-ptx), without compromising labeler preference scores. InstructGPT still makes simple mistakes. For example, InstructGPT can still fail to follow instructions, make up facts, give long hedging answers to simple questions, or fail to detect instructions with false premises$$\nSome notes on RLHF Step 1: Supervised Fine Tuning: We ﬁne-tune GPT-3 on our labeler demonstrations using supervised learning. We trained for 16 epochs, using a cosine learning rate decay, and residual dropout of 0.2\nStep 2 : Reward model Starting from the SFT model with the ﬁnal unembedding layer removed, we trained a model to take in a prompt and response, and output a scalar reward The underlying goal is to get a model or system that takes in a sequence of text, and returns a scalar reward which should numerically represent the human preference. These reward models are themselves pretty huge. 6B parameters in Open AI case\nStep 3: Fine-tuning with RL using PPO PPO : Proximal Policy Optimization Given the prompt and response, it produces a reward determined by the reward model and ends the episode. In addition, we add a per-token KL penalty from the SFT model at each token to mitigate overoptimization of the reward model. The value function is initialized from the RM. We call these models “PPO.”\nFrom : https://huggingface.co/blog/rlhf “Let’s first formulate this fine-tuning task as a RL problem. First, the policy is a language model that takes in a prompt and returns a sequence of text (or just probability distributions over text). The action space of this policy is all the tokens corresponding to the vocabulary of the language model (often on the order of 50k tokens) and the observation space is the distribution of possible input token sequences, which is also quite large given previous uses of RL (the dimension is approximately the size of vocabulary ^ length of the input token sequence). The reward function is a combination of the preference model and a constraint on policy shift.” Concatenated with the original prompt, that text is passed to the preference model, which returns a scalar notion of “preferability”, rθ​. In addition, per-token probability distributions from the RL policy are compared to the ones from the initial model to compute a penalty on the difference between them. In multiple papers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and DeepMind, this penalty has been designed as a scaled version of the Kullback–Leibler (KL) divergence between these sequences of distributions over tokens, r_kl. The KL divergence term penalizes the RL policy from moving substantially away from the initial pretrained model with each training batch, which can be useful to make sure the model outputs reasonably coherent text snippets. Finally, the update rule is the parameter update from PPO that maximizes the reward metrics in the current batch of data (PPO is on-policy, which means the parameters are only updated with the current batch of prompt-generation pairs). PPO is a trust region optimization algorithm that uses constraints on the gradient to ensure the update step does not destabilize the learning process.\nHelpful schematic showing the RL fine-tune process Final Thoughts InstructGPT outputs are more appropriate in the context of a customer assistant, more often follow explicit constraints deﬁned in the instruction (e.g. “Write your answer in 2 paragraphs or less.”),\nAre less likely to fail to follow the correct instruction entirely,\nAre less likely to make up facts (‘hallucinate’) less often in closed-domain tasks. These results suggest that InstructGPT models are more reliable and easier to control than GPT-3\nComparison of GPT vs Instruct GPT [Part 1] Deep dive into Mistral Models Brief introduction to Mistral models, their architecture, and key features We refer to the paper: Mistral 7b Objective: The search for balanced models delivering both high-level performance and efficiency\nKey Results: Mistral 7B outperforms the previous best 13B model (Llama 2, [ 26]) across all tested benchmarks, and surpasses the best 34B model (LLaMa 34B, [ 25 ]) in mathematics and code generation. Furthermore, Mistral 7B approaches the coding performance of Code-Llama 7B [ 20 ], without sacrificing performance on non-code related benchmarks\nKey Insights: Mistral 7B leverages grouped-query attention (GQA) [ 1 ], and sliding window attention (SWA) [6, 3]. GQA significantly accelerates the inference speed, and also reduces the memory requirement during decoding, allowing for higher batch sizes hence higher throughput, a crucial factor for real-time applications. In addition, SWA is designed to handle longer sequences more effectively at a reduced computational cost\nSliding Window Attention Why? The number of operations in vanilla attention is quadratic in the sequence length, and the memory increases linearly with the number of tokens. At inference time, this incurs higher latency and smaller throughput due to reduced cache availability. To alleviate this issue, we use sliding window attention: each token can attend to at most W tokens from the previous layer Note that tokens outside the sliding window still influence next word prediction. At each attention layer, information can move forward by W tokens. Hence, after k attention layers, information can move forward by up to k × W tokens SWA exploits the stacked layers of a transformer to attend information beyond the window size W . The hidden state in position i of the layer k, hi, attends to all hidden states from the previous layer with positions between i − W and i. Recursively, hi can access tokens from the input layer at a distance of up to W × k tokens, as illustrated in Figure 1. At the last layer, using a window size of W = 4096, we have a theoretical attention span of approximately131K tokens. In practice, for a sequence length of 16K and W = 4096, changes made to FlashAttention [ 11 ] and xFormers [18 ] yield a 2x speed improvement over a vanilla attention baseline. This fixed attention span, means we can implement a rolling buffer cache. After W size, the cache starts overwriting the from the beginning. This also allows some pre-filling based optimizations.\nComparison with Llama Instruction Finetuning To evaluate the generalization capabilities of Mistral 7B, we fine-tuned it on instruction datasets publicly available on the Hugging Face repository. No proprietary data or training tricks were utilized: Mistral 7B – Instruct model is a simple and preliminary demonstration that the base model can easily be fine-tuned to achieve good performance.\nSystem prompt We introduce a system prompt (see below) to guide the model to generate answers within specified guardrails, similar to the work done with Llama 2. The prompt: “Always assist with care, respect, and truth. Respond with utmost utility yet securely. Avoid harmful, unethical, prejudiced, or negative content. Ensure replies promote fairness and positivity.”\nHow to select various model sizes, a Thumbrule from Mistral AI.

Overview of Eval metrics Before we understand and compare deepseeks performance, here’s a quick overview on how models are measured on code specific tasks.\nLeaderboard is provided here : https://evalplus.github.io/leaderboard.html\nWhat is HumanEval ? https://github.com/openai/human-eval\nHumanEval consists of 164 hand-written Python problems that are validated using test cases to assess the code generated by a Code LLM in a zero-shot setting,\nWhat is MBPP ? https://huggingface.co/datasets/mbpp\nWhile the MBPP benchmark includes 500 problems in a few-shot setting.\nDS-1000: More practical programming tasks, compared to Human Eval DS-1000 benchmark, as introduced in the work by Lai et al. (2023), offers a comprehensive collection of 1,000 practical and realistic data science workflows across seven different libraries\nDeepseek coder Summary Each model in the series has been trained from scratch on 2 trillion tokens sourced from 87 programming languages, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of coding languages and syntax. Refer to the paper from DeepSeek coder: DeepSeek Code Useful links:\nhttps://deepseekcoder.github.io/\nhttps://ollama.com/library/deepseek-coder/tags\nHow it’s built Repository Context in Pre-training Besides, we attempt to organize the pretraining data at the repository level to enhance the pre-trained model’s understanding capability within the context of cross-files within a repository They do this, by doing a topological sort on the dependent files and appending them into the context window of the LLM. More details below.\nWe find that it can significantly boost the capability of cross-file code generation\nNext token prediction + Fill-in-the middle (like BERT) In addition to employing the next token prediction loss during pre-training, we have also incorporated the Fill-In-Middle (FIM) approach.\n16K context window (Mistral models have 4K sliding window attention) To meet the requirements of handling longer code inputs, we have extended the context length to 16K. This adjustment allows our models to handle more complex and extensive coding tasks, thereby increasing their versatility and applicability in various coding scenarios\nData Preparation Filtering Rule: TL;DR: Remove non-code related, or data heavy files\nRemove files with avg line length \u003e 100, OR, maximum line length \u003e 1000 characters.\nRemove files with fewer than 25% alphabetic characters\nremove \u003c?xml version files\nJSON/YAML files - keep fields that have character counts ranging from 50 -\u003e 5000 . This removes data-heavy files.\nDependency Parsing Instead of simply passing in the current file, the dependent files within repository are parsed.\nParse Dependency between files, then arrange files in order that ensures context of each file is before the code of the current file. By aligning files based on dependencies, it accurately represents real coding practices and structures.\nThis enhanced alignment not only makes our dataset more relevant but also potentially increases the practicality and applicability of the model in handling project-level code scenarios It’s worth noting that we only consider the invocation relationships between files and use regular expressions to extract them, such as\"import\" in Python, “using” in C#, and “include” in C. A topological sort algorithm for doing this is provided in the paper.\nTo incorporate file path information, a comment indicating the file’s path is added at the beginning of each file.\nModel Architecture Each model is a decoder-only Transformer, incorporating Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) Notably, the DeepSeek 33B model integrates Grouped-Query-Attention (GQA) as described by Su et al. (2023), with a group size of 8, enhancing both training and inference efficiency. Additionally, we employ FlashAttention v2 (Dao, 2023) to expedite the computation involved in the attention mechanism we use AdamW (Loshchilov and Hutter, 2019) as the optimizer with 𝛽1 and 𝛽2 values of 0.9 and 0.95. he learning rate at each stage is scaled down to√︃ 110 of the preceding stage’s rate Context Length:\nTheoretically, these modifications enable our model to process up to 64K tokens in context. However, empirical observations suggest that the model delivers its most reliable outputs within a 16K token range.\\\nInstruction Tuning This data comprises helpful and impartial human instructions, structured by the Alpaca Instruction format. To demarcate each dialogue turn, we employed a unique delimiter token \u003c|EOT|\u003e\nPerformance Surpasses GPT3.5, and within reach of GPT4\nTo evaluate the model’s multilingual capabilities, we expanded the Python problems of Humaneval Benchmark to seven additional commonly used programming languages, namely C++, Java, PHP, TypeScript (TS), C#, Bash, and JavaScript (JS) (Cassano et al.,2023). For both benchmarks, We adopted a greedy search approach and re-implemented the baseline results using the same script and environment for fair comparison. Interesting Notes Chain of thought prompting\nOur analysis indicates that the implementation of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting notably enhances the capabilities of DeepSeek-Coder-Instruct models. This improvement becomes particularly evident in the more challenging subsets of tasks. By adding the directive, “You need first to write a step-by-step outline and then write the code.” following the initial prompt, we have observed enhancements in performance. This observation leads us to believe that the process of first crafting detailed code descriptions assists the model in more effectively understanding and addressing the intricacies of logic and dependencies in coding tasks, particularly those of higher complexity. Therefore, we strongly recommend employing CoT prompting strategies when utilizing DeepSeek-Coder-Instruct models for complex coding challenges.\n[Part 1] Model Quantization Along with instruction fine-tuning, another neat technique that makes LLM’s more performant (in terms of memory and resources), is model quantization\nModel quantization enables one to reduce the memory footprint, and improve inference speed - with a tradeoff against the accuracy.\nIn short, Quantization is a process from moving the weights of the model, from a high-information type like fp32 to a low-information but performant data-type like int8\nReference: Huggingface guide on quantization - https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum/en/concept_guides/quantization\nThe two most common quantization cases are float32 -\u003e float16 and float32 -\u003e int8.\nSome schematics that explain the concept.\n{:height 362, :width 719}\nQuantization to Int8 Let’s consider a float x in [a, b], then we can write the following quantization scheme, also called the affine quantization scheme:\nx = S * (x_q - Z) x_q is the quantized int8 value associated to x\nS is the scale, and is a positive float32\nZ is called the zero-point, it is the int8 value corresponding to the value 0 in the float32 realm.\nx_q = round(x/S + Z) x_q = clip(round(x/S + Z), round(a/S + Z), round(b/S + Z)) In effect, this means that we clip the ends, and perform a scaling computation in the middle. The clip-off obviously will lose to accuracy of information, and so will the rounding.\nCalibration An example, explaining calibration to optimise clipping vs rounding error\n{:height 187, :width 314}\nTo ensure that we have a good balance of clipping vs rounding errors, based on the range [a, b] that we select. Some techniques are available\nUse per-channel granularity for weights and per-tensor for activations\nQuantize residual connections separately by replacing blocks\nIdentify sensitive layers and skip them from quantization\nhttps://huggingface.co/blog/4bit-transformers-bitsandbytes\nModel quantization + instruct = Quite Good results\nGood reference reading on the topic: https://deci.ai/quantization-and-quantization-aware-training\nWhat’s next This post was more around understanding some fundamental concepts, I’ll not take this learning for a spin and try out deepseek-coder model.

We then collect a dataset of human-written demonstrations of the desired output behavior on (mostly English) prompts submitted to the OpenAI API3 and some labeler-written prompts, and use this to train our supervised learning baselines.

First, the <strong>policy</strong> is a language model that takes in a prompt and returns a sequence of text (or just probability distributions over text). The <strong>action space</strong> of this policy is all the tokens corresponding to the vocabulary of the language model (often on the order of 50k tokens) and the <strong>observation space</strong> is the distribution of possible input token <em>sequences</em>, which is also quite large given previous uses of RL (the dimension is approximately the size of vocabulary ^ length of the input token sequence). The <strong>reward function</strong> is a combination of the preference model and a constraint on policy shift.&rdquo;
Concatenated with the original prompt, that text is passed to the preference model, which returns a scalar notion of “preferability”, r<em>θ</em>​. In addition, per-token probability distributions from the RL policy are compared to the ones from the initial model to compute a penalty on the difference between them. In multiple papers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and DeepMind, this penalty has been designed as a scaled version of the Kullback–Leibler <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kullback%E2%80%93Leibler_divergence>(KL) divergence</a> between these sequences of distributions over tokens, r_kl. The KL divergence term penalizes the RL policy from moving substantially away from the initial pretrained model with each training batch, which can be useful to make sure the model outputs reasonably coherent text snippets.
Finally, the <strong>update rule</strong> is the parameter update from PPO that maximizes the reward metrics in the current batch of data (PPO is on-policy, which means the parameters are only updated with the current batch of prompt-generation pairs). PPO is a trust region optimization algorithm that uses constraints on the gradient to ensure the update step does not destabilize the learning process.</p></blockquote><h4 id=helpful-schematic-showing-the-rl-fine-tune-process>Helpful schematic showing the RL fine-tune process<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#helpful-schematic-showing-the-rl-fine-tune-process>#</a></h4><p><img loading=lazy src=https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/blog/rlhf/rlhf.png alt="RL Process"></p><h3 id=final-thoughts>Final Thoughts<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#final-thoughts>#</a></h3><p>InstructGPT outputs are more appropriate in the context of a customer assistant, more often follow explicit constraints deﬁned in the instruction (e.g. “Write your answer in 2 paragraphs or less.”),</p><p>Are less likely to fail to follow the correct instruction entirely,</p><p>Are less likely to make up facts (‘hallucinate’) less often in closed-domain tasks.

GQA significantly accelerates the inference speed, and also reduces the memory requirement during decoding, allowing for higher batch sizes hence higher throughput, a crucial factor for real-time applications. In addition, SWA is designed to handle longer sequences more effectively at a reduced computational cost</p></blockquote><h3 id=sliding-window-attention>Sliding Window Attention<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#sliding-window-attention>#</a></h3><h4 id=why>Why?<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#why>#</a></h4><blockquote><p>The number of operations in vanilla attention is quadratic in the sequence length, and the memory increases linearly with the number of tokens. At inference time, this incurs higher latency and smaller throughput due to reduced cache availability. To alleviate this issue, we use sliding window attention: each token can attend to at most W tokens from the previous layer
<img loading=lazy src=/image_1711811647174_0.png alt=image.png></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Note that tokens outside the sliding window still influence next word prediction. At each attention layer, information can move forward by W tokens. Hence, after k attention layers, information can move forward by up to k × W tokens
SWA exploits the stacked layers of a transformer to attend information beyond the window size W . The hidden state in position i of the layer k, hi, attends to all hidden states from the previous layer with positions between i − W and i. Recursively, hi can access tokens from the input layer at a distance of up to W × k tokens, as illustrated in Figure 1. At the last layer, using a window size of W = 4096, we have a theoretical attention span of approximately131K tokens. In practice, for a sequence length of 16K and W = 4096, changes made to FlashAttention [ 11 ] and xFormers [18 ] yield a 2x speed improvement over a vanilla attention baseline.
This fixed attention span, means we can implement a rolling buffer cache. After W size, the cache starts overwriting the from the beginning. This also allows some pre-filling based optimizations.</p></blockquote><h3 id=comparison-with-llama>Comparison with Llama<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#comparison-with-llama>#</a></h3><p><img loading=lazy src=/image_1711812059350_0.png alt=image.png></p><h3 id=instruction-finetuning>Instruction Finetuning<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#instruction-finetuning>#</a></h3><blockquote><p>To evaluate the generalization capabilities of Mistral 7B, we fine-tuned it on instruction datasets publicly available on the Hugging Face repository.

</code></pre><p><code>x_q</code> is the quantized <code>int8</code> value associated to <code>x</code></p><p><code>S</code> is the scale, and is a positive <code>float32</code></p><p><code>Z</code> is called the zero-point, it is the <code>int8</code> value corresponding to the value <code>0</code> in the <code>float32</code> realm.</p><pre tabindex=0><code>x_q = round(x/S + Z)
</code></pre><pre tabindex=0><code>x_q = clip(round(x/S + Z), round(a/S + Z), round(b/S + Z))
</code></pre><p>In effect, this means that we clip the ends, and perform a scaling computation in the middle.
