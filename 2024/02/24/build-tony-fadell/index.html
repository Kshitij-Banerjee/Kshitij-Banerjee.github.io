He certainly has some of the biggest products in the world under his belt, So i’m definitely taking notes on what this guy has to teach me.\nI’ve read enough books on entrepreneurship, business and startups - but I think this one has more specific advice than the typical 0-1 book. I’m going to mention the ones that I thought were noteworthy for me / unique views. Do read the full book if you think these resonate.\nFair warning: The summary is a bit larger than usual. That’s because the topics in each chapter are completely different, so the book packs a lot of interesting quotes and wisdom that I end up taking a note of. Feel free to skip to the topics that most interest you.\nSummary in 200 kilobytes What to work on If you’re passionate about something—something that could be solving a huge problem one day—then stick with it.\nOne day, if you are truly solving a real problem, when the world is ready to want it, you’ll already be there.\nHow to work with your heroes If you have a hero you want to work with, follow them, bring something interesting to them, ask interesting questions. Don’t ask for a job / meeting, but persistence and being genuinely interested and helpful will work.\nAnd if that seems impossible—if you follow your heroes on Twitter but can’t imagine they’ll ever pay any attention to you—I’m excited to tell you that that is complete bullshit. I doubt I’m anyone’s hero, but I’m an experienced, well-connected product designer who’s been lucky enough to make some famous technology. Most people assume I won’t pay any attention to people who randomly DM me on Twitter or send me unsolicited emails out of the blue. But sometimes I do. Not when people are just asking for a job. Or angling for funding. But I’ll notice people who come with something interesting to share. Something smart. Especially if they keep coming. If they sent me something cool last week and something cool this week and they keep bringing fascinating news or tech or ideas and they’re persistent, then I’ll start to recognize them. I’ll start to remember them, and respond. And that can turn into an introduction or a friendship or a referral or, potentially, a job at one of our portfolio companies. The key is persistence and being helpful. Not just asking for something, but offering something.\nHow IC’s should grow 20 percent of the time, individual contributors need to look up. And they need to look around. The sooner they start, the faster and higher they’ll advance in their career. Looking up - means looking forward in the future of your work, to make sure you’re going in the right direction\nLooking around - means making sure that other functions that you need help from, are also on track and you’re not losing rhythm with them\n“Your job isn’t just doing your job. It’s also to think like your manager or CEO. You need to understand the ultimate goal, even if it’s so far away that you’re not really sure what it’ll look like when you get there”\nBeing a great manager Remember that once you become a manager, you’ll stop doing the thing that made you successful in the first place. You’ll no longer be doing the things you do really well—instead you’ll be digging into how others do them, helping them improve. Your job will now be communication, communication, communication, recruiting, hiring and firing, setting budgets, reviews, one-on-one meetings (1:1s), meetings with your team and other teams and leadership, representing your team in those meetings, setting goals and keeping people on track, conflict resolution, helping to find creative solutions to intractable problems, blocking and tackling political BS, mentoring your team, and asking “how can I help you?” all the time.\nBecoming a manager is a discipline. Management is a learned skill, not a talent. You’re not born with it.\nBeing exacting and expecting great work is not micromanagement. Your job is to make sure the team produces high-quality work.\nDon’t worry that your team will outshine you. In fact, it’s your goal. You should always be training someone on your team to do your job. The better they are, the easier it is for you to move up and even start managing managers.\nOne of the hardest parts of management is letting go. Not doing the work yourself. You have to temper your fear that becoming more hands-off will cause the product to suffer or the project to fail. You have to trust your team—give them breathing room to be creative and opportunities to shine.\n1:1s with individuals should have an agenda, a clear purpose, and should be beneficial to both sides. You should get the info you need about product development and your team members should get insight into how they’re doing. Try to see the situation from their point of view—talk about their fears and your own concerns out loud, reframe your thoughts so they can hear the feedback, understand the goals, clear up ambiguities or concerns.\nDealing with Assholes Types of assholes\nPolitical assholes: The people who master the art of corporate politics, but then do nothing but take credit for everyone else’s work. These assholes are typically incredibly risk averse—they’re focused exclusively on surviving and pushing others down so they can reach the top.\nControlling assholes: Micromanagers who systematically strangle the creativity and joy out of their team. These assholes can never be reasoned with. They resent any good idea that didn’t come from them and are extremely threatened by anyone on their team who is more talented than they are.\nAsshole assholes: They suck at work and everything else. These are the mean, jealous, insecure jerks who you’d avoid at a party, but who inevitably sit immediately next to you at the office. They cannot deliver, are deeply unproductive\nMission-driven “assholes”: The people who are crazy passionate—and a little crazy. They speak most frankly, trampling the politics of the modern office, and steamroll right over the delicate social order of “how things are done around here.” Much like true assholes, they are neither easygoing nor easy to work with. Unlike true assholes, they care. They give a damn. They listen. They work incredibly hard and push their team to be better—often against their will.\nHow to deal with them\nKill ’em with kindness.\nIgnore them.\nTry to get around them.\nQuit.\nIn that order\nMost people aren’t assholes. And even if they are, they’re also human. So don’t walk into a job trying to get anyone fired. Start with kindness. Try to make peace. Assume the best. and if that doesn’t work, then remember that what goes around comes around. Although it never comes fast enough\nWhen to quit You’re no longer passionate about the mission. If you’re staying for the paycheck or to get the title you want, but every hour at your desk feels like an eternity, then save yourself.\nYou’ve tried everything. You’re still passionate about the mission but the company is letting you down. So you’ve talked to your manager, to other teams, to HR, and to senior leadership. You’ve tried to understand the roadblocks and pitched solutions and options. But still, your project is going nowhere or your manager is impossible or the company is falling apart. In that case, you should leave that job but stick to the mission and find another team on a similar journey.\nBuilding great experiences When building 0-\u003e1 products, most think about prototypes.\nBut don’t just make a prototype of your product and think you’re done. Prototype as much of the full customer experience as possible. Make the intangible tangible so you can’t overlook the less showy but incredibly important parts of the journey. You should be able to map out and visualize exactly how a customer discovers, considers, installs, uses, fixes, and even returns your product. It all matters.\nYour product isn’t only your product. It’s the whole user experience—a chain that begins when someone learns about your brand for the first time and ends when your product disappears from their life, returned or thrown away, sold to a friend or deleted in a burst of electrons.\nBuilders sometimes think only about the product, but prototyping and imagining the entire customer experience is what many miss\nStorytelling Appeal to the pain that users have to go through. Appeal to the emotional feelings aroused when you talk about the struggles they have to face to solve this particular problem.\nBy the time you describe the solution, the audience should already be engaged and physically annoyed with the problem.\nThe story of your product, your company, and your vision should drive everything you do\nWhen you describe the solution, you need to boil down the complicated concept into simple words.\nAnalogies can be such a useful tool in storytelling. They create a shorthand for complicated concepts—a bridge directly to a common experience.\nA great analogy allows a customer to instantly grasp a difficult feature and then describe that feature to others. That’s why “1,000 songs in your pocket” was so powerful.\nEvolution vs Disruption Your version one (V1) product should be disruptive, not evolutionary.\nAssuming V1 was at least a critical success, the second version of your product is typically an evolution of your first. Refine what you made in V1 using data and insights from actual customers and double down on your original disruption. The execution should step up a notch—\nDon’t overshoot. Don’t try to disrupt too many things at once. Focus on solving one thing first, and when you’ve solved that go for another\nYou focus on making one amazing thing but forget that it has to be part of a single, fluid experience.\nHeartbeats Don’t have too many external launches, even if you can. You need to let your customers gain balance, before you throw another ball at them to catch\nHaving a well known heartbeat, both external, project and team-wise is important - because deadlines are important.\nPeople will do their most creative and constructive work, when they have a sense of timelines and urgency.\nThe chasm - Custom adoption curve Geoffrey Moore first mapped out when different people are open to new products in his book Crossing the Chasm.\nToread Crossing the chasm\n(Not) Killing yourself Steve jobs was obsessed with Apple. But not everyone should be Steve. Having a balance, and knowing what balance is right for you is good.\nTo manage his work and keep things in order, interestingly - he used the same GTD concept to manage work.\nAdditionally he made his list-of-things and projects completely public to his teams. That way everyone knew what he was focussing on. Eventually people followed and started doing the same.\nAssistants are good way for senior executives to delegate machinery work like booking meetings/emails so that the executive can stay productive . Assistants can be shared executives so save cost\nHow to handle a crisis Everyone goes through a moment of crisis and breakfppints\nKeep your focus on fixing the problem and not who to blame, that can be solved later\nGet in the weeds. Don’t worry about micromanagement . Release the pressure and let people do work once things are in control\nGet advice from mentors and investors\nConstant communication - externally and internally\nAccept responsibility as a leader and listen to feedback.\nHiring The best teams are multi generational. Experienced people have wisdom, but it takes energy to build, so you need younger people too.\nThe 3 crown strategy - Your hiring committee should have 1) The hiring manager, 2) manager of eventual custom of candidate. Example: for UX designer customer would be engineers.\nWhat makes a good recruiter: People who are actually excited about the product, and can create and tell a good story\nImportant questions to ask: Why you left the previous company, and why you’d like to join this one ? It needs to be a compelling and flowing story.\nAdvise on onboarding new people - They need a lot of help from the manager. Show them how to work in the environment and what the culture is - so they don’t feel lonely and feel scared.\nYou’ll also need to fire people. Don’t be scared of it, but don’t be callous, either. Give people plenty of warning and opportunity to course correct, follow the letter of the law, then bite the bullet and help them find a better opportunity.\nBreakpoints Breakpoints are intentional and planned points in a companies journey, where the company must pause and change things about the way they work.\nTypically these arise as more and more people are joining and the company is growing. The old ways of working don’t work anymore and change is needed.\nA communication strategy becomes very important as the team and company scales. You need effective ways to articulate leadership vision throughout.\nAs your company increased, some individuals and teams will have to focus instead of go at breadth. This will be hard to do but is important to keep functions working great .\nMeetings They become too much and overwhelming . But important .\nManagers have to keep track of how many and how much time is spent and optimise it\nCulture Is the hardest thing to pinpoint and the hardest to preserve. Even\nSo to preserve what you love, have your team write down the things they value most and build a plan to continue them.\nCulture arises organically but then needs to be codified to be maintained.\nAlways remember that change is growth and growth is opportunity. Your company is an organism; its cells need to divide to multiply, they need to differentiate to become something new. Don’t worry about what you’re going to lose—think about what you’re going to become.\nDesign Thinking Design is not just a profession. A customer is not only a person who buys something. A product is not just a physical object or software that you sell. You can employ design thinking for everything you do.\nDesign thinking forces you to really understand the problem you’re trying to solve. In this case, the problem isn’t “I need a car to get to work.” It’s actually much broader: “How do I want to get around?” The product you’re designing is a mobility strategy for your life.\nLiterally the only way to make a really good product is to dig in, analyze your customer’s needs, and explore all the possible options (including the unexpected ones: maybe I can work from home, maybe I can move closer to work). There are no perfect designs. There are always constraints. But you choose the best of all the options—aesthetically, functionally, and at the necessary price point. That’s a design process.\nAvoid Habituation:\nMost people are so habituated to the problems in their home lives or work that they no longer realize they’re problems. You can’t solve interesting problems if you don’t notice they’re there.\nProduct Marketing Method Marketing cannot just be figured out at the very end. Use marketing to prototype your product narrative from the beginning.\nThe creative team can help you make the product narrative tangible. This should happen in parallel with product development—one should feed the other.\nThe best marketing is just telling the truth. The ultimate job of marketing is to find the very best way to tell the true story of your product.\nMessaging Architecture: To make the story feel real, to make it tangible, you need to visualize it.\nIt’s essential for product development: Product management and marketing work on the messaging architecture from day one.\nIt’s a living and shared document.\nThe process of convincing someone to buy and use your product needs to respect the customer, needs to understand their needs at different points of the user experience. You\nExample from Nest:\nTop-line billboards would just introduce the idea of a new kind of thermostat. The packaging would highlight the top six features and how the product connects to your phone. The website would emphasize energy savings and showcase how Nest fits into your daily life. The usage guide inside the packaging would provide more detail about how to train the learning algorithm and tips for saving energy. The support site would go deeper with exact instructions and thorough explanations of all the features.\nThe point of PM’s …\nTo Be Continued … The good thing about this book, is that each chapter is unique and talks about a different topic. As such, I read and take these notes in peace-meals on my MRT rides. The blog is published weekly, when I get the time to sync Logseq with Hugo.

It’s the whole user experience—a chain that begins when someone learns about your brand for the first time and ends when your product disappears from their life, returned or thrown away, sold to a friend or deleted in a burst of electrons.</p><p>Builders sometimes think only about the product, but prototyping and imagining the <em>entire</em> customer experience is what many miss</p><p><img loading=lazy src=/image_1708846523545_0.png alt=image.png></p><h2 id=storytelling>Storytelling<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#storytelling>#</a></h2><p>Appeal to the pain that users have to go through. Appeal to the emotional feelings aroused when you talk about the struggles they have to face to solve this particular problem.</p><p>By the time you describe the solution, the audience should already be engaged and physically annoyed with the problem.</p><p>The story of your product, your company, and your vision should drive everything you do</p><p>When you describe the solution, you need to boil down the complicated concept into simple words.</p><p>Analogies can be such a useful tool in storytelling. They create a shorthand for complicated concepts—a bridge directly to a common experience.</p><p>A great analogy allows a customer to instantly grasp a difficult feature and then describe that feature to others. That’s why “1,000 songs in your pocket” was so powerful.</p><h2 id=evolution-vs-disruption>Evolution vs Disruption<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#evolution-vs-disruption>#</a></h2><p>Your version one (V1) product should be disruptive, not evolutionary.</p><p>Assuming V1 was at least a critical success, the second version of your product is typically an evolution of your first. Refine what you made in V1 using data and insights from actual customers and double down on your original disruption. The execution should step up a notch—</p><p>Don&rsquo;t overshoot. Don&rsquo;t try to disrupt too many things at once. Focus on solving one thing first, and when you&rsquo;ve solved that go for another</p><p>You focus on making one amazing thing but forget that it has to be part of a single, fluid experience.</p><h2 id=heartbeats>Heartbeats<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#heartbeats>#</a></h2><p><img loading=lazy src=/image_1708852523899_0.png alt=image.png></p><p>Don&rsquo;t have too many external launches, even if you can. You need to let your customers gain balance, before you throw another ball at them to catch</p><p>Having a well known heartbeat, both external, project and team-wise is important - because deadlines are important.</p><p>People will do their most creative and constructive work, when they have a sense of timelines and urgency.</p><h2 id=the-chasm---custom-adoption-curve>The chasm - Custom adoption curve<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#the-chasm---custom-adoption-curve>#</a></h2><p><img loading=lazy src=/image_1708852677097_0.png alt=image.png></p><p>Geoffrey Moore first mapped out when different people are open to new products in his book Crossing the Chasm.</p><p>Toread Crossing the chasm</p><h2 id=not-killing-yourself>(Not) Killing yourself<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#not-killing-yourself>#</a></h2><p>Steve jobs was obsessed with Apple. But not everyone should be Steve. Having a balance, and knowing what balance is right for you is good.</p><p>To manage his work and keep things in order, interestingly - he used the same GTD concept to manage work.</p><p>Additionally he made his list-of-things and projects completely public to his teams. That way everyone knew what he was focussing on. Eventually people followed and started doing the same.</p><p>Assistants are good way for senior executives to delegate machinery work like booking meetings/emails so that the executive can stay productive . Assistants can be shared executives so save cost</p><h2 id=how-to-handle-a-crisis>How to handle a crisis<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#how-to-handle-a-crisis>#</a></h2><p>Everyone goes through a moment of crisis and breakfppints</p><ol><li><p>Keep your focus on fixing the problem and not who to blame, that can be solved later</p></li><li><p>Get in the weeds. Don’t worry about micromanagement . Release the pressure and let people do work once things are in control</p></li><li><p>Get advice from mentors and investors</p></li><li><p>Constant communication - externally and internally</p></li><li><p>Accept responsibility as a leader and listen to feedback.</p></li></ol><h2 id=hiring>Hiring<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#hiring>#</a></h2><p>The best teams are multi generational. Experienced people have wisdom, but it takes energy to build, so you need younger people too.</p><p>The 3 crown strategy - Your hiring committee should have 1) The hiring manager, 2) manager of eventual custom of candidate. Example: for UX designer customer would be engineers.</p><p>What makes a good recruiter: People who are actually excited about the product, and can create and tell a good story</p><p>Important questions to ask: Why you left the previous company, and why you&rsquo;d like to join this one ? It needs to be a compelling and flowing story.</p><p>Advise on onboarding new people - They need a lot of help from the manager. Show them how to work in the environment and what the culture is - so they don’t feel lonely and feel scared.</p><p>You’ll also need to fire people. Don’t be scared of it, but don’t be callous, either. Give people plenty of warning and opportunity to course correct, follow the letter of the law, then bite the bullet and help them find a better opportunity.</p><h2 id=breakpoints>Breakpoints<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#breakpoints>#</a></h2><p>Breakpoints are intentional and planned points in a companies journey, where the company must pause and change things about the way they work.</p><p>Typically these arise as more and more people are joining and the company is growing. The old ways of working don&rsquo;t work anymore and change is needed.</p><p>A communication strategy becomes very important as the team and company scales. You need effective ways to articulate leadership vision throughout.</p><p>As your company increased, some individuals and teams will have to focus instead of go at breadth. This will be hard to do but is important to keep functions working great .</p><h3 id=meetings>Meetings<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#meetings>#</a></h3><p>They become too much and overwhelming . But important .</p><p>Managers have to keep track of how many and how much time is spent and optimise it</p><h3 id=culture>Culture<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#culture>#</a></h3><p>Is the hardest thing to pinpoint and the hardest to preserve. Even</p><p>So to preserve what you love, have your team write down the things they value most and build a plan to continue them.</p><p>Culture arises organically but then needs to be codified to be maintained.</p><p>Always remember that change is growth and growth is opportunity. Your company is an organism; its cells need to divide to multiply, they need to differentiate to become something new. Don’t worry about what you’re going to lose—think about what you’re going to become.</p><h2 id=design-thinking>Design Thinking<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#design-thinking>#</a></h2><p>Design is not just a profession. A customer is not only a person who buys something. A product is not just a physical object or software that you sell. You can employ design thinking for everything you do.</p><p>Design thinking forces you to really understand the problem you’re trying to solve. In this case, the problem isn’t “I need a car to get to work.” It’s actually much broader: “How do I want to get around?” The product you’re designing is a mobility strategy for your life.</p><p>Literally the only way to make a really good product is to dig in, analyze your customer’s needs, and explore all the possible options (including the unexpected ones: maybe I can work from home, maybe I can move closer to work). There are no perfect designs. There are always constraints. But you choose the best of all the options—aesthetically, functionally, and at the necessary price point. That’s a design process.</p><p><strong>Avoid Habituation</strong>:</p><p>Most people are so habituated to the problems in their home lives or work that they no longer realize they’re problems. You can’t solve interesting problems if you don’t notice they’re there.</p><h2 id=product-marketing-method>Product Marketing Method<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#product-marketing-method>#</a></h2><p>Marketing cannot just be figured out at the very end. Use marketing to prototype your product narrative <em>from the beginning.</em></p><p>The creative team can help you make the product narrative tangible. This should happen in parallel with product development—one should feed the other.</p><p>The best marketing is just telling the truth. The ultimate job of marketing is to find the very best way to tell the true story of your product.</p><h3 id=messaging-architecture><em>Messaging Architecture:</em><a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#messaging-architecture>#</a></h3><p>To make the story feel real, to make it tangible, you need to visualize it.</p><p>It’s essential for product development: Product management and marketing work on the messaging architecture from day one.</p><p>It&rsquo;s a living and shared document.</p><p>The process of convincing someone to buy and use your product needs to respect the customer, needs to understand their needs at different points of the user experience. You</p><p>Example from Nest:</p><p>Top-line billboards would just introduce the idea of a new kind of thermostat. The packaging would highlight the top six features and how the product connects to your phone. The website would emphasize energy savings and showcase how Nest fits into your daily life. The usage guide inside the packaging would provide more detail about how to train the learning algorithm and tips for saving energy. The support site would go deeper with exact instructions and thorough explanations of all the features.</p><h2 id=the-point-of-pms>The point of PM&rsquo;s<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#the-point-of-pms>#</a></h2><p>&mldr;</p><h1 id=to-be-continued->To Be Continued &mldr;<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#to-be-continued->#</a></h1><p>The good thing about this book, is that each chapter is unique and talks about a different topic.
