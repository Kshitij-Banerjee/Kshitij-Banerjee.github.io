The book is not about facts and science, but based on tonyâ€™s experience and deals with subjective concepts like how to build products, dealing with assholes, and how to hire etc.
Overall, 4/5 stars for me, and I recommend reading it. It covers one strong individuals strong opinions, about how to deal with matters one must deal with when building impactful products.</description></item><item><title>Exploring Code LLMs</title><link>https://Kshitij-Banerjee.github.io/2017/04/14/exploring-code-llms/</link><pubDate>Fri, 14 Apr 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Kshitij-Banerjee.github.io/2017/04/14/exploring-code-llms/</guid><description>Introduction The goal of this post is to deep-dive into LLM&amp;rsquo;s that are specialised in code generation tasks, and see if we can use them to write code.
Note: Unlike copilot, we&amp;rsquo;ll focus on locally running LLM&amp;rsquo;s. This should be appealing to any enterprises that have data privacy and sharing concerns, but still want to improve developer productivity.
To test our understanding, we&amp;rsquo;ll perform a few simple coding tasks, and compare the various methods in achieving the desired results and also show the shortcomings.</description></item></channel></rss>
