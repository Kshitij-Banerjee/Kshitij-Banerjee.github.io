The book is not about facts and science, but based on tonyâ€™s experience and deals with subjective concepts like how to build products, dealing with assholes, and how to hire etc.
Overall, 4/5 stars for me, and I recommend reading it. It covers one strong individuals strong opinions, about how to deal with matters one must deal with when building impactful products.</description></item><item><title>Getting Things Done with LogSeq</title><link>https://Kshitij-Banerjee.github.io/2024/02/16/getting-things-done-with-logseq/</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Kshitij-Banerjee.github.io/2024/02/16/getting-things-done-with-logseq/</guid><description>Introduction I was first introduced to the concept of &amp;ldquo;second-brain&amp;rdquo; from Tobi Lutke, the founder of Shopify. The topic started because someone asked whether he still codes - now that he is a founder of such a large company. Tobi went on to explain that he spent the weekend writing some code to customise Logseq to his preferences, and that he&amp;rsquo;s an active member of the Logseq community.
The following weekend, I setup Logseq and learnt its weird ways of working, and have since been an ardent user and fan of the Logseq/Obsidian methodology of building a &amp;ldquo;second-brain&amp;rdquo;</description></item><item><title>Exploring Code LLMs</title><link>https://Kshitij-Banerjee.github.io/2017/04/14/exploring-code-llms/</link><pubDate>Fri, 14 Apr 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Kshitij-Banerjee.github.io/2017/04/14/exploring-code-llms/</guid><description>Introduction The goal of this post is to deep-dive into LLM&amp;rsquo;s that are specialised in code generation tasks, and see if we can use them to write code.
Note: Unlike copilot, we&amp;rsquo;ll focus on locally running LLM&amp;rsquo;s. This should be appealing to any enterprises that have data privacy and sharing concerns, but still want to improve developer productivity.
To test our understanding, we&amp;rsquo;ll perform a few simple coding tasks, and compare the various methods in achieving the desired results and also show the shortcomings.</description></item></channel></rss>
