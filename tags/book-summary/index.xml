The book is not about facts and science, but based on tony’s experience and deals with subjective concepts like how to build products, dealing with assholes, and how to hire etc.
Overall, 4/5 stars for me, and I recommend reading it. It covers one strong individuals strong opinions, about how to deal with matters one must deal with when building impactful products.</description></item><item><title>Grit - Angela Duckworth</title><link>https://Kshitij-Banerjee.github.io/2022/12/12/grit-angela-duckworth/</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Kshitij-Banerjee.github.io/2022/12/12/grit-angela-duckworth/</guid><description>Book Summary - Grit by Angela Duckworth The post is a book summary of the main bullet points from the book &amp;ldquo;Grit&amp;rdquo; by &amp;ldquo;Angela Duckworth&amp;rdquo;
