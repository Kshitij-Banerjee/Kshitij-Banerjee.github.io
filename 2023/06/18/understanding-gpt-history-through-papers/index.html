Unfortunately, as of the time of this writing, he hasn’t updated this series in the last 6 months. In short, andrej is teaching us how the modern LLMs came to be, by going through the series of seminal papers that led to its formation - and andrej was kind enough to walk us through the details in his video series. But it has currently left a hole in our understanding. The series jumps straight from wave nets, to transformers and GPT and it leaves a lot to be filled.\nSo as I go on my path to understand the history, I’d like this to fill the gap for anyone else who might be going through the same journey. I believe, andrej will eventually complete this series in terms of code, and when it does - it will be a far better source than this post will ever be.\nBut, if you’re like me, and looking for a crash-course on the various papers and the core concepts. Follow along:-\nPapers NOT be going through The following papers are ones, that andrew has explained in a lot of detail in his make more lecture series on YouTube , and I would recommend anyone to go through the series - as its the best explanation I’ve seen so far.\nBigram (one character predicts the next one with a lookup table of counts)\nMLP, following Bengio\nCNN, following DeepMind WaveNet 2016\nPapers intend to deep-dive into: [[RNN]] , following Mikolov et al. 2010 [[Backpropagation through time ]], followed in Mikael Bod ́en 2001 [[LSTM]] , following Graves et al. 2014 [[GRU]] , following Kyunghyun Cho et al. 2014 [[Batch Normalisation]], following Sergey Ioffe et al. 2015 [[Attention]], following Dzmitry Bahdanau, 2015 [[Layer Normalization]], following Jimmy Lei Ba, 2016 [[Transformers]] , following Vaswani et al. 2017 Let’s get started RNN - Recurrent Neural Networks Paper: Mikolov et al. 2010\nSummary\nIn effect, the paper references the MLP paper by Bengio, and cites the shortcoming that the context length is fixed and manually set. (The context length is the number of previous tokens that are fed into the MLP to generate the next word).\nQuoting the author:-\nIt is well known that humans can exploit longer context with great success. Also, cache models provide comple-\nmentary information to neural network models, so it is natural to think about a model that would encode temporal information\nimplicitly for contexts with arbitrary lengths\nThe authors then explain how a simple recurrent neural network works\nWhere\nw(t) is the input word at t\ns(t-1) is the state previously generated by the RNN in its last time-step\nOutput layer y(t) represents probability distribution of next word given previous word w(t) and context. Consequently, time needed to train optimal network increases faster than just linearly with increased amount of training data: vocabulary growth increases the input and output layer sizes, and also the optimal hidden layer size increases with more training data.\nBack-propagation through time (BPTT) algorithm is used. (This is covered next)\nNotable lines:\nBased on our experiments, size of hidden layer should reflect amount of training data - for large\namounts of data, large hidden layer is needed\nConvergence is usually achieved after 10-20 epochs.\nregularization of networks to penalize large weights did not provide any significant improvements.\n[[Backpropagation through time ]], followed in Mikael Bod ́en 2001\nThe key insight is around how to back-propagate through the recursion caused loop\nThe solution is to “unroll” the model T times, and then follow normal backpropation\nInstead, of keeping separate weight matrix for each time-step, the weight matrix is instead shared across the unfolded layers.\nNote, how weights V and U , remain the same through the unfolding process\nImportant quotes from the paper:\nIt is important to note, however, that after error deltas have been calculated, weights\nare folded back adding up to one big change for each weight. Obviously there is a greater\nmemory requirement (both past errors and activations need to be stored away), the larger\nτ we choose.\nIn practice, a large τ is quite useless due to a “vanishing gradient effect” (see e.g.\n(Bengio et al., 1994)). For each layer the error is backpropagated through the error\ngets smaller and smaller until it diminishes completely. Some have also pointed out that\nthe instability caused by possibly ambiguous deltas (e.g. (Pollack, 1991)) may disrupt\nconvergence. An opposing result has been put forward for certain learning tasks (Bod ́en\net al., 1999).\nNote that batch normalization and layer normalization were probably not present at this time.\nPyTorch\nCode Doc\nInput:\n(N,L,H**in​) when batch_first=True\nN = Batch Size\nL = Sequence Length\nH_in = Hidden Layer\nLSTM - Long Short-term Memory Paper: Graves et al. 2014 Generating Sequences With Recurrent Neural Networks\nSummary\nQuoting the paper to best describe the problem they are addressing\nIn practice however, standard RNNs are unable to\nstore information about past inputs for very long [15].
