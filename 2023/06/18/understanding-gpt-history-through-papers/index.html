But it has currently left a hole in our understanding. The series jumps straight from wave nets, to transformers and GPT and it leaves a lot to be filled.\nSo as I go on my path to understand the history, I’d like this to fill the gap for anyone else who might be going through the same journey. I believe, andrej will eventually complete this series in terms of code, and when it does - it will be a far better source than this post will ever be.\nBut, if you’re like me, and looking for a crash-course on the various papers and the core concepts. Follow along:-\nPapers NOT be going through The following papers are ones, that andrew has explained in a lot of detail in his make more lecture series on YouTube , and I would recommend anyone to go through the series - as its the best explanation I’ve seen so far.\nBigram (one character predicts the next one with a lookup table of counts)\nMLP, following Bengio\nCNN, following DeepMind WaveNet 2016\nPapers intend to deep-dive into: RNN , following Mikolov et al. 2010 Recurrent neural network based language model Backpropagation through time , followed in Mikael Bod ́en 2001 BPTT LSTM , following Graves et al. 2014 Generating Sequences With Recurrent Neural Networks GRU , following Kyunghyun Cho et al. 2014 On the Properties of Neural Machine Translation: Encoder–Decoder Batch Normalisation, following Sergey Ioffe et al. 2015 Batch Normalization: Accelerating Deep Network Training by Reducing Internal Covariate Shift Attention, following Dzmitry Bahdanau, 2015 Dzmitry Bahdanau, 2015 Layer Normalization, following Jimmy Lei Ba, 2016 Layer Normalization Transformers , following Vaswani et al. 2017 Attention Is All You Need Let’s get started RNN - Recurrent Neural Networks Paper: Mikolov et al. 2010\nSummary\nIn effect, the paper references the MLP paper by Bengio, and cites the shortcoming that the context length is fixed and manually set. (The context length is the number of previous tokens that are fed into the MLP to generate the next word).\nQuoting the author:-\nIt is well known that humans can exploit longer context with great success. Also, cache models provide comple-\nmentary information to neural network models, so it is natural to think about a model that would encode temporal information\nimplicitly for contexts with arbitrary lengths\nThe authors then explain how a simple recurrent neural network works\nWhere\nw(t) is the input word at t\ns(t-1) is the state previously generated by the RNN in its last time-step\nOutput layer y(t) represents probability distribution of next word given previous word w(t) and context. Consequently, time needed to train optimal network increases faster than just linearly with increased amount of training data: vocabulary growth increases the input and output layer sizes, and also the optimal hidden layer size increases with more training data.\nBack-propagation through time (BPTT) algorithm is used. (This is covered next)\nNotable lines:\nBased on our experiments, size of hidden layer should reflect amount of training data - for large\namounts of data, large hidden layer is needed\nConvergence is usually achieved after 10-20 epochs.\nregularization of networks to penalize large weights did not provide any significant improvements.\nBackpropagation through time , followed in Mikael Bod ́en 2001\nThe key insight is around how to back-propagate through the recursion caused loop\nThe solution is to “unroll” the model T times, and then follow normal backpropation\nInstead, of keeping separate weight matrix for each time-step, the weight matrix is instead shared across the unfolded layers.\nNote, how weights V and U , remain the same through the unfolding process\nImportant quotes from the paper:\nIt is important to note, however, that after error deltas have been calculated, weights\nare folded back adding up to one big change for each weight. Obviously there is a greater\nmemory requirement (both past errors and activations need to be stored away), the larger\nτ we choose.\nIn practice, a large τ is quite useless due to a “vanishing gradient effect” (see e.g.\n(Bengio et al., 1994)). For each layer the error is backpropagated through the error\ngets smaller and smaller until it diminishes completely. Some have also pointed out that\nthe instability caused by possibly ambiguous deltas (e.g. (Pollack, 1991)) may disrupt\nconvergence. An opposing result has been put forward for certain learning tasks (Bod ́en\net al., 1999).\nNote that batch normalization and layer normalization were probably not present at this time.\nPyTorch\nCode Doc\nInput:\n(N,L,H**in​) when batch_first=True\nN = Batch Size\nL = Sequence Length\nH_in = Hidden Layer\nBidirectional RNN Paper: Mike et al 1997 paper Future input information coming up later than is usually also useful for prediction. With an RNN, this can be partially\nachieved by delaying the output by a certain number of time frames to include future information. While delaying the output by some frames has been used successfully to improve results in a practical speech recogni-\ntion system [12], which was also confirmed by the experiments conducted here, the optimal delay is task dependent and has to be found by the “trial and error” error method on a validation test set.\nTo overcome the limitations of a regular RNN outlined in the previous section, we propose a bidirectional recurrent\nneural network (BRNN) that can be trained using all available input information in the past and future of a specific time frame.\nLSTM - Long Short-term Memory Paper: Graves et al. 2014 Generating Sequences With Recurrent Neural Networks\nSummary\nQuoting the paper to best describe the problem they are addressing\nIn practice however, standard RNNs are unable to\nstore information about past inputs for very long [15]. As well as diminishing\ntheir ability to model long-range structure, this ‘amnesia’ makes them prone to\ninstability when generating sequences. The problem (common to all conditional\ngenerative models) is that if the network’s predictions are only based on the last\nfew inputs, and these inputs were themselves predicted by the network, it has\nlittle opportunity to recover from past mistakes. Having a longer memory has\na stabilising effect, because even if the network cannot make sense of its recent\nhistory, it can look further back in the past to formulate its predictions.\nIn my words, I understand it as follows\nThe forget gate, tries to find how much to forget in the next iteration. The network learns weights, such that for certain inputs x, at hidden states h and a previous cell state c[t-1] - it predicts how to forget in the next iteration\nSimlarly, the input gate learns how much to store in the new cell state at t.\nCombining both, the new c[t] is a Fc[t-1] + I(WX+Wh+b)\nThe paper has some great examples of text generation and handwriting prediction using LSTMs, that I would encourage going through.\nPaper 2 by Google: hasim et al. 2014 hasim et all The recurrent connections in the\nLSTM layer are directly from the cell output units to the cell input\nunits, input gates, output gates and forget gates. The cell output units\nare connected to the output layer of the network.\nPyTorch:\nReference: https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.LSTM.html\nGRU - Gated Recurrent Neural Networks Paper:\nCho et. al 2014 Learning Phrase representations using Encoder-Decoder On the Properties of Neural Machine Translation: On the Properties of Neural Machine Translation: Encoder–Decoder paper From the Papers:\nIn addition to a novel model architecture, we also\npropose a new type of hidden unit (f in Eq. (1))\nthat has been motivated by the LSTM unit but is\nmuch simpler to compute and implement.1 Fig. 2\nshows the graphical depiction of the proposed hidden unit.\nWe show that the neural machine translation performs\nrelatively well on short sentences without unknown words,\nbut its performance de-grades rapidly as the length of the sentence\nand the number of unknown words increase.\nFurthermore, we find that the pro-posed gated recursive convolutional net-\nwork learns a grammatical structure of a sentence automatically.\nIn my words, they simplified the task to an update gate and a reset gate, instead of the complicated interactions between multiple gates in LSTMs.\nBoth the reset gates and update gates are a function of the input, and the hidden state at t-1\nand the next h state is calculated as\nAs each hidden unit has separate reset and update gates, each hidden unit will learn to capture dependencies over different time scales.\nThose units that learn to capture short-term dependencies will tend to have reset gates that are frequently active, but those that capture longer-term dependencies will have update gates that are mostly active.\nBatch Normalisation Paper: Batch Normalisation, following Sergey Ioffe et al. 2015 Batch Normalization: Accelerating Deep Network Training by Reducing Internal Covariate Shift The problem\nTraining is complicated by the fact that the inputs to each layer\nare affected by the parameters of all preceding layers – so\nthat small changes to the network parameters amplify as\nthe network becomes deeper.\nChange in the distributions of layers’ inputs presents a problem because the layers need to continu-\nously adapt to the new distribution.\nInput distribution properties that make training more efficient – such as having the same distribution\nbetween the training and test data – apply to training the sub-network as well. As such it is advantageous for the\ndistribution of x to remain fixed over time.\nConsider a layer with a sigmoid activation function z = g(W u + b) where u is the layer input,\nthe weight matrix W and bias vector b are the layer parameters to be learned, and g(x) = 1/ 1+exp(−x) . As |x|\nincreases, g′(x) tends to zero. This means that for all dimensions of x = W u+b except those with small absolute values, the gradient flowing down to u will vanish and the model will train slowly.\nIf, however, we could ensure that the distribution of nonlinearity inputs remains more\nstable as the network trains, then the optimizer would be less likely to get stuck in the saturated regime,and the training would accelerate.\nSo they propose a new solution\nThe Solution: Introduce a normalization step that fixes the means and variances of every layer inputs\nWhat they tried: One approach could be to modify the network directly at regular intervals, to maintain the normalisation properties. They explain that this doesn’t work because\nThe issue with the above approach is that the gradient descent optimization does not take into account the fact that the normalization takes place.\nWe have observed this empirically in initial experiments, where the\nmodel blows up when the normalization parameters are\ncomputed outside the gradient descent step\nAnd hence they proposed the solution to bring the batch-normalisation layer\nTo address this issue, we would like to ensure that, for any parameter values,\nthe network always produces activations with the desired\ndistribution. Doing so would allow the gradient of the\nloss with respect to the model parameters to account for\nthe normalization, and for its dependence on the model\nparameters Θ\nThe Batch Normalisation Layer Algo Important points: ####### Normalises dimensions independently:\nThe algorithm works to normalise each dimension independently. So for each dimension k, it hopes to normalise Enables the layers to still adapt It’s important to not change what each layer represents. So they don’t want to specifically force every activation to be of mean 0 and variance 1. Instead, they introduce the scaling parameters to let the network still learn the biases and scaling factors. The algorithm merely ensures that the distribution of the inputs is maintained.\nThis is done via\nNote that this enables the network to retain the representation\nCons: Creates coupling between the examples in the training\nRather, BNγ,β (x) depends both on the training example and the other examples in the mini-batch.\nThe BN layer is differentiable: Normalization is only needed during training The normalization of activations that\ndepends on the mini-batch allows efficient training, but is\nneither necessary nor desirable during inference\nHence after training, only the population statistics is used for the providing the same effect during inference\nThese statistics are calculated by using moving average method\nWe use the unbiased variance estimate Var[x] = m\nm−1 · EB[σ^2 ], where\nthe expectation is over training mini-batches of size m and σ^2 are their sample variances\nSince the means and variances are fixed during inference,\nthe normalization is simply a linear transform applied to\neach activation.\nFinal Algorithm TO BE CONTINUED..\n","wordCount":"2137","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-06-18T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-06-18T00:00:00Z","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://Kshitij-Banerjee.github.io/2023/06/18/understanding-gpt-history-through-papers/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"KiloBytes by KB","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://Kshitij-Banerjee.github.io/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://Kshitij-Banerjee.github.io accesskey=h title="KiloBytes by KB (Alt + H)">KiloBytes by KB</a><div class=logo-switches></div></div><ul id=menu></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><h1 class=post-title>Understanding GPT History through papers</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2023-06-18 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>June 18, 2023</span></div></header><div class=post-content><h1 id=introduction>Introduction<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#introduction>#</a></h1><p>This post is inspired by Andrej Karpathy&rsquo;s <a href=https://github.com/karpathy/makemore>makemore</a> series.

As such it is advantageous for the<br>distribution of x to remain fixed over time.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Consider a layer with a sigmoid activation function z = g(W u + b) where u is the layer input,<br>the weight matrix W and bias vector b are the layer parameters to be learned, and g(x) = 1/ 1+exp(−x) .
