Given its importance, the rush to build new products and research on top is understandable. But, I&amp;rsquo;ve always liked to ground myself with foundational knowledge on how things work, before exploring anything additive. To gain such foundational knowledge, I believe understanding the progression of techniques and models is crucial to comprehend how these LLM models work under the hood.</description></item><item><title>Loss Functions In ML</title><link>https://Kshitij-Banerjee.github.io/2023/02/17/loss-functions-in-ml/</link><pubDate>Fri, 17 Feb 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Kshitij-Banerjee.github.io/2023/02/17/loss-functions-in-ml/</guid><description>Introduction Loss functions tell the algorithm how far we are from actual truth, and their gradients/derivates help understand how to reduce the overall loss (by changing the parameters being trained on) All losses in keras defined here
Frequently we see the loss function being expressed as a negative loss, why is that so? Plot: As probabilities only lie between [0-1], the plot is only relevant between X from 0-1
This means, that it penalises a low probability of success exponentially more.</description></item><item><title>Intro to ML</title><link>https://Kshitij-Banerjee.github.io/2023/01/20/intro-to-ml/</link><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Kshitij-Banerjee.github.io/2023/01/20/intro-to-ml/</guid><description>Introduction Note: These are my rough notes, which are auto-synced from my private LogSeq, and is a WIP.
I&amp;rsquo;ll update and make these more readable in the future (which possibly means never :D)
Lecture Notes: https://cs229.stanford.edu/notes2022fall/main_notes.pdf Notations A pair (x^{(i)}, y^{(i)}) is called a training example, the superscript “(i)” in the notation is simply an index into the training set, and has nothing to do with exponentiation.
The notation “a := b” to denote an assignment operation</description></item><item><title>Book Summary - Grit by Angela Duckworth</title><link>https://Kshitij-Banerjee.github.io/2022/12/12/book-summary-grit-by-angela-duckworth/</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Kshitij-Banerjee.github.io/2022/12/12/book-summary-grit-by-angela-duckworth/</guid><description>Book Summary - Grit by Angela Duckworth The post is a book summary of the main bullet points from the book &amp;ldquo;Grit&amp;rdquo; by &amp;ldquo;Angela Duckworth&amp;rdquo;
Components of Grit The book breaks down grit in the following components:-
Interest: I love what I do
Practice: I will do what it takes to improve and become world class
Purpose: What I do is important for everyone
Hope: I will keep going even when it’s difficult</description></item><item><title>Largest Area Under a Histogram (and related concepts/problems).</title><link>https://Kshitij-Banerjee.github.io/2017/01/30/largest-area-under-a-histogram-and-related-concepts/problems./</link><pubDate>Mon, 30 Jan 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Kshitij-Banerjee.github.io/2017/01/30/largest-area-under-a-histogram-and-related-concepts/problems./</guid><description>A problem with a clever solution, with some insights to its construction</description></item><item><title>The Classic Laptop Dev Configuration - Linux/Mac (Tutorial)</title><link>https://Kshitij-Banerjee.github.io/2017/01/24/the-classic-laptop-dev-configuration-linux/mac-tutorial/</link><pubDate>Tue, 24 Jan 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Kshitij-Banerjee.github.io/2017/01/24/the-classic-laptop-dev-configuration-linux/mac-tutorial/</guid><description>The classic list of dev tools and configurations that I can&amp;#39;t live without (and how to set them up).</description></item><item><title>Reverse Engineer data from raw database files.</title><link>https://Kshitij-Banerjee.github.io/1/01/01/reverse-engineer-data-from-raw-database-files./</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Kshitij-Banerjee.github.io/1/01/01/reverse-engineer-data-from-raw-database-files./</guid><description>How to recover data from raw .tokudb files!
