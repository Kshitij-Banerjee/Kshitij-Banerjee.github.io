# Introduction

This post is inspired by Andrej Karpathy's [makemore](https://github.com/karpathy/makemore) series. Unfortunately, as of the time of this writing, he hasn't updated this series in the last 6 months. In short, andrej is teaching us how the modern LLMs came to be, by going through the series of seminal papers that led to its formation - and andrej was kind enough to walk us through the details in his video series. But it has currently left a hole in our understanding. The series jumps straight from wave nets, to transformers and GPT and it leaves a lot to be filled.

So as I go on my path to understand the history, I'd like this to fill the gap for anyone else who might be going through the same journey.
	  I believe, andrej will eventually complete this series in terms of code, and when it does - it will be a far better source than this post will ever be.  
	  But, if you're like me, and looking for a crash-course on the various papers and the core concepts. Follow along:-  
## Papers NOT be going through

The following papers are ones, that andrew has explained in a lot of detail in his make more lecture series on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaCmpygFfXo) , and I would recommend anyone to go through the series - as its the best explanation I've seen so far.

## Let's get started

### RNN - Recurrent Neural Networks

**Paper:** [Mikolov et al. 2010](https://www.fit.vutbr.cz/research/groups/speech/publi/2010/mikolov_interspeech2010_IS100722.pdf)

**Summary**

In effect, the paper references the MLP paper by [Bengio](https://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume3/bengio03a/bengio03a.pdf), and cites the shortcoming that the context length is fixed and manually set. (The context length is the number of previous tokens that are fed into the MLP to generate the next word).

Quoting the author:-

> It is well known that humans can exploit longer context with great success. Also, cache models provide comple-  
mentary information to neural network models, so it is natural to think about a model that would encode temporal information  
implicitly for contexts with arbitrary lengths  
The authors then explain how a simple recurrent neural network works

![image.png](/image_1687079552173_0.png)

Where

w(t) is the input word at t

s(t-1) is the state previously generated by the RNN in its last time-step

Output layer y(t) represents probability distribution of next word given previous word w(t) and context. Consequently, time needed to train optimal network increases faster than just linearly with increased amount of training data: vocabulary growth increases the input and output layer sizes, and also the optimal hidden layer size increases with more training data.

Back-propagation through time (BPTT) algorithm is used. (This is covered next)

Notable lines:

> Based on our experiments, size of hidden layer should reflect amount of training data - for large  
amounts of data, large hidden layer is needed  
> Convergence is usually achieved after 10-20 epochs.  
> regularization of networks to penalize large weights did not provide any significant improvements.  
Backpropagation through time , followed in Mikael Bod ́en 2001

The key insight is around how to back-propagate through the recursion caused loop

The solution is to "unroll" the model T times, and then follow normal backpropation

Instead, of keeping separate weight matrix for each time-step, the weight matrix is instead shared across the unfolded layers.

![image.png](/image_1687080413026_0.png)

Note, how weights V and U , remain the same through the unfolding process

Important quotes from the paper:

> It is important to note, however, that after error deltas have been calculated, weights  
are folded back adding up to one big change for each weight. Obviously there is a greater  
memory requirement (both past errors and activations need to be stored away), the larger  
τ we choose.  
> In practice, a large τ is quite useless due to a “vanishing gradient effect” (see e.g.  
(Bengio et al., 1994)). For each layer the error is backpropagated through the error  
gets smaller and smaller until it diminishes completely. Some have also pointed out that  
the instability caused by possibly ambiguous deltas (e.g. (Pollack, 1991)) may disrupt  
convergence. An opposing result has been put forward for certain learning tasks (Bod ́en  
et al., 1999).  
Note that batch normalization and layer normalization were probably not present at this time.

N = Batch Size

L  = Sequence Length

H_in = Hidden Layer

### Bidirectional RNN

Paper: Mike et al 1997 {{< pdflink "https://deeplearning.cs.cmu.edu/F23/document/readings/Bidirectional%20Recurrent%20Neural%20Networks.pdf" "paper" >}}

> Future input information coming up later than is usually also useful for prediction. With an RNN, this can be partially  
achieved by delaying the output by a certain number of time frames to include future information. While delaying the output by some frames has been used successfully to improve results in a practical speech recogni-  
tion system [12], which was also confirmed by the experiments conducted here, the optimal delay is task dependent and has to be found by the “trial and error” error method on a validation test set.  
> To overcome the limitations of a regular RNN outlined in the previous section, we propose a bidirectional recurrent  
neural network (BRNN) that can be trained using all available input information in the past and future of a specific time frame.

### LSTM - Long Short-term Memory

**Paper:** Graves et al. 2014 [Generating Sequences With Recurrent Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1308.0850.pdf)

**Summary**

Quoting the paper to best describe the problem they are addressing

> In practice however, standard RNNs are unable to  
store information about past inputs for very long [15]. As well as diminishing  
their ability to model long-range structure, this ‘amnesia’ makes them prone to  
instability when generating sequences. The problem (common to all conditional  
generative models) is that if the network’s predictions are only based on the last  
few inputs, and these inputs were themselves predicted by the network, it has  
little opportunity to recover from past mistakes. Having a longer memory has  
a stabilising effect, because even if the network cannot make sense of its recent  
history, it can look further back in the past to formulate its predictions.

In my words, I understand it as follows

The forget gate, tries to find how much to forget in the next iteration. The network learns weights, such that for certain inputs x, at hidden states h and a previous cell state c[t-1] - it predicts how to forget in the next iteration

Simlarly, the input gate learns how much to store in the new cell state at t.

Combining both, the new c[t] is a F*c[t-1] + I*(WX+Wh+b)

The paper has some great examples of text generation and handwriting prediction using LSTMs, that I would encourage going through.

Paper 2 by Google:  hasim et al. 2014  {{< pdflink "https://arxiv.org/pdf/1402.1128.pdf" "hasim et all" >}}

> The recurrent connections in the  
LSTM layer are directly from the cell output units to the cell input  
units, input gates, output gates and forget gates. The cell output units  
are connected to the output layer of the network.

### GRU - Gated Recurrent Neural Networks

Paper:

[Cho et. al 2014](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.1078.pdf) {{< pdflink "https://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.1078.pdf" "Learning Phrase representations using Encoder-Decoder" >}}

{{< pdflink "https://arxiv.org/pdf/1412.3555.pdf" "paper" >}}

**From the Papers:**

> In addition to a novel model architecture, we also  
propose a new type of hidden unit (f in Eq. (1))  
that has been motivated by the LSTM unit but is  
much simpler to compute and implement.1 Fig. 2  
shows the graphical depiction of the proposed hidden unit.  
> We show that the neural machine translation performs  
relatively well on short sentences without unknown words,   
but its performance de-grades rapidly as the length of the sentence  
and the number of unknown words increase.   
Furthermore, we find that the pro-posed gated recursive convolutional net-  
work learns a grammatical structure of a sentence automatically.  
![image.png](/image_1687355590275_0.png)

In my words, they simplified the task to an update gate and a reset gate, instead of the complicated interactions between multiple gates in LSTMs.

Both the reset gates and update gates are a function of the input, and the hidden state at t-1

![image.png](/image_1687590382787_0.png)

![image.png](/image_1687590390930_0.png)

and the next h state is calculated as

![image.png](/image_1687590493510_0.png)

As each hidden unit has separate reset and update gates, each hidden unit will learn to capture
		  dependencies over different time scales.  
Those units that learn to capture short-term dependencies
		  will tend to have reset gates that are frequently active, but those that capture longer-term dependencies will have update gates that are mostly active.
