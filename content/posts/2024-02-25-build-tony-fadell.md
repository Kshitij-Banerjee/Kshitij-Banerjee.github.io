# Introduction

Tony Fadell is CEO of nest (bought by google ), and instrumental in building products at Apple like the iPod and the iPhone.

The book is not about facts and science, but based on tony’s experience and deals with subjective concepts like how to build products, dealing with assholes, and how to hire etc.

Overall, 4/5 stars for me, and I recommend reading it. It covers one strong individuals strong opinions, about how to deal with matters one must deal with when building impactful products. He certainly has some of the biggest products in the world under his belt, So i’m definitely taking notes on what this guy has to teach me.

I've read enough books on entrepreneurship, business and startups - but I think this one has more specific advice than the typical 0-1 book. I'm going to mention the ones that I thought were noteworthy for me / unique views. Do read the full book if you think these resonate.

## What to work on

If you’re passionate about something—something that could be solving a huge problem one day—then stick with it.

One day, if you are truly solving a real problem, when the world is ready to want it, you’ll already be there.

## How to work with your heroes

If you have a hero you want to work with, follow them, bring something interesting to them, ask interesting questions. Don't ask for a job / meeting, but persistence and being genuinely interested and helpful will work.

> And if that seems impossible—if you follow your heroes on Twitter but can’t imagine they’ll ever pay any attention to you—I’m excited to tell you that that is complete bullshit. I doubt I’m anyone’s hero, but I’m an experienced, well-connected product designer who’s been lucky enough to make some famous technology. Most people assume I won’t pay any attention to people who randomly DM me on Twitter or send me unsolicited emails out of the blue. But sometimes I do. Not when people are just asking for a job. Or angling for funding. But I’ll notice people who come with something interesting to share. Something smart. Especially if they keep coming. If they sent me something cool last week and something cool this week and they keep bringing fascinating news or tech or ideas and they’re persistent, then I’ll start to recognize them. I’ll start to remember them, and respond. And that can turn into an introduction or a friendship or a referral or, potentially, a job at one of our portfolio companies.
The key is persistence and being helpful. Not just asking for something, but offering something.

## How IC's should grow

> 20 percent of the time, individual contributors need to look up. And they need to look around. The sooner they start, the faster and higher they’ll advance in their career.
Looking up - means looking forward in the future of your work, to make sure you're going in the right direction

Looking around - means making sure that other functions that you need help from, are also on track and you're not losing rhythm with them

*"Your job isn’t just doing your job. It’s also to think like your manager or CEO. You need to understand the ultimate goal, even if it’s so far away that you’re not really sure what it’ll look like when you get there"*

## Being a great manager

Remember that once you become a manager, you’ll stop doing the thing that made you successful in the first place. You’ll no longer be doing the things you do really well—instead you’ll be digging into how others do them, helping them improve. Your job will now be communication, communication, communication, recruiting, hiring and firing, setting budgets, reviews, one-on-one meetings (1:1s), meetings with your team and other teams and leadership, representing your team in those meetings, setting goals and keeping people on track, conflict resolution, helping to find creative solutions to intractable problems, blocking and tackling political BS, mentoring your team, and asking “how can I help you?” all the time.

Becoming a manager is a discipline. Management is a learned skill, not a talent. You’re not born with it.

Being exacting and expecting great work is not micromanagement. Your job is to make sure the team produces high-quality work.

Don’t worry that your team will outshine you. In fact, it’s your goal. You should always be training someone on your team to do your job. The better they are, the easier it is for you to move up and even start managing managers.

One of the hardest parts of management is letting go. Not doing the work yourself. You have to temper your fear that becoming more hands-off will cause the product to suffer or the project to fail. You have to trust your team—give them breathing room to be creative and opportunities to shine.

1:1s with individuals should have an agenda, a clear purpose, and should be beneficial to both sides. You should get the info you need about product development and your team members should get insight into how they’re doing. Try to see the situation from their point of view—talk about their fears and your own concerns out loud, reframe your thoughts so they can hear the feedback, understand the goals, clear up ambiguities or concerns.

## Dealing with Assholes

Types of assholes

1. *Political assholes*: The people who master the art of corporate politics, but then do nothing but take credit for everyone else’s work. These assholes are typically incredibly risk averse—they’re focused exclusively on surviving and pushing others down so they can reach the top.

2. *Controlling assholes*: Micromanagers who systematically strangle the creativity and joy out of their team. These assholes can never be reasoned with. They resent any good idea that didn’t come from them and are extremely threatened by anyone on their team who is more talented than they are.

3. *Asshole assholes*: They suck at work and everything else. These are the mean, jealous, insecure jerks who you’d avoid at a party, but who inevitably sit immediately next to you at the office. They cannot deliver, are deeply unproductive

4. *Mission-driven “assholes”*: The people who are crazy passionate—and a little crazy. They speak most frankly, trampling the politics of the modern office, and steamroll right over the delicate social order of “how things are done around here.” Much like true assholes, they are neither easygoing nor easy to work with. Unlike true assholes, they care. They give a damn. They listen. They work incredibly hard and push their team to be better—often against their will.

*How to deal with them*

1. Kill ’em with kindness.

2. Ignore them.

3. Try to get around them.

4. Quit.

In that order

*__Most people aren’t assholes. And even if they are, they’re also human. So don’t walk into a job trying to get anyone fired. Start with kindness. Try to make peace. Assume the best. and if that doesn’t work, then remember that what goes around comes around. Although it never comes fast enough__*

## When to quit

You’re no longer passionate about the mission. If you’re staying for the paycheck or to get the title you want, but every hour at your desk feels like an eternity, then save yourself.

You’ve tried everything. You’re still passionate about the mission but the company is letting you down. So you’ve talked to your manager, to other teams, to HR, and to senior leadership. You’ve tried to understand the roadblocks and pitched solutions and options. But still, your project is going nowhere or your manager is impossible or the company is falling apart. In that case, you should leave that job but stick to the mission and find another team on a similar journey.

## Building great experiences

When building 0->1 products, most think about prototypes.

**But don’t just make a prototype of your product and think you’re done. Prototype as much of the full customer experience as possible. Make the intangible tangible so you can’t overlook the less showy but incredibly important parts of the journey. You should be able to map out and visualize exactly how a customer discovers, considers, installs, uses, fixes, and even returns your product. It all matters.**

Your product isn’t only your product. It’s the whole user experience—a chain that begins when someone learns about your brand for the first time and ends when your product disappears from their life, returned or thrown away, sold to a friend or deleted in a burst of electrons.

Builders sometimes think only about the product, but prototyping and imagining the *entire* customer experience is what many miss

## Storytelling

Appeal to the pain that users have to go through. Appeal to the emotional feelings aroused when you talk about the struggles they have to face to solve this particular problem.

By the time you describe the solution, the audience should already be engaged and physically annoyed with the problem.

The story of your product, your company, and your vision should drive everything you do

When you describe the solution, you need to boil down the complicated concept into simple words.

Analogies can be such a useful tool in storytelling. They create a shorthand for complicated concepts—a bridge directly to a common experience.

A great analogy allows a customer to instantly grasp a difficult feature and then describe that feature to others. That’s why “1,000 songs in your pocket” was so powerful.

## Evolution vs Disruption

Your version one (V1) product should be disruptive, not evolutionary.

Assuming V1 was at least a critical success, the second version of your product is typically an evolution of your first. Refine what you made in V1 using data and insights from actual customers and double down on your original disruption. The execution should step up a notch—

Don't overshoot. Don't try to disrupt too many things at once. Focus on solving one thing first, and when you've solved that go for another

You focus on making one amazing thing but forget that it has to be part of a single, fluid experience.

## Heartbeats

Don't have too many external launches, even if you can. You need to let your customers gain balance, before you throw another ball at them to catch

Having a well known heartbeat, both external, project and team-wise is important - because deadlines are important.

People will do their most creative and constructive work, when they have a sense of timelines and urgency.

# To Be Continued ...

The good thing about this book, is that each chapter is unique and talks about a different topic. As such, I read and take these notes in peace-meals on my MRT rides. The blog is published weekly, when I get the time to sync Logseq with Hugo. *Remaining: 45%*
